UML diagrams
-> Structural diagrams
    -> example: Class diagram, object diagram
    Student's 
        attribute
            - CRN
            - NAME
            - Phone
        attendence()
        reports()
-> Behavioral diagrams
    -> use case diagram
    -> activity diagram
    -> sequence diagram


stakeholders-> those who are related to the entity
    for eg. for our college stakeholders are students, teachers, staffs, BOD's, management staff,and all of the peps related to the college


use cases -> ellipses
actors -> stickman

relations->
    associations
    include (like validator)
    extend (optional)
    generalization-> eg for payment, payment can be of 
                                                    -> payment by cash 
                                                    -> payment by bank
                                                    -> payment by wallet
                                                    so we broke down generic case payment by 3 methods.

system boundary-> what can all of the entities in a system can do?
